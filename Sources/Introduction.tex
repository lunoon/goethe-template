%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is a minimal, modern template for writing your Bachelor, Master, or PhD thesis. It is based on \href{https://github.com/Pseudomanifold/latex-mimosis}{\texttt{latex-mimosis}}, which in turn is based on the style advice given by people such as Robert
Bringhurst~\cite{Bringhurst12} or Edward R.\
Tufte~\cite{Tufte90,Tufte01}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{How?}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

You can use \LaTeX, \XeLaTeX, or \LuaLaTeX. If in doubt, prefer \LuaLaTeX, which is the most modern.

By default, this document uses the following font settings:
\begin{verbatim}
  \setmainfont{EB Garamond}
  \setmonofont[Scale=MatchLowercase]{Source Code Pro}
\end{verbatim}
Make sure that you install these fonts, so that the document can be rendered properly. The default is good, but you are free to change the font.

    A list of the most relevant packages required~(and automatically imported) by this template.
  }
  \label{tab:Packages}
\end{table}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The template automatically imports numerous convenience packages that
aid in your typesetting process. \autoref{tab:Packages} lists the
most important ones. Let's briefly discuss some examples below. Please
refer to the source code for more demonstrations.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Typesetting mathematics}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This template uses \verb|amsmath| and \verb|amssymb|, which are the
de-facto standard for typesetting mathematics. Use numbered equations
using the \verb|equation| environment.
%
If you want to show multiple equations and align them, use the
\verb|align| environment:
%
\begin{align}
    V &:= \{ 1, 2, \dots \}\\
    E &:= \big\{ \left(u,v\right) \mid \dist\left(p_u, p_v\right) \leq \epsilon \big\}
\end{align}
%
Define new mathematical operators using \verb|\DeclareMathOperator|.
Some operators are already pre-defined by the template, such as the
distance between two objects. Please see the template for some examples. 
%
Moreover, this template contains a correct differential operator. Use \verb|\diff| to typeset the differential of integrals:
%
\begin{equation}
  f(u) := \int_{v \in \domain}\dist(u,v)\diff{v}
\end{equation}
%
You can see that, as a courtesy towards most mathematicians, this
template gives you the possibility to refer to the real numbers~$\real$
and the domain~$\domain$ of some function. Take a look at the source for
more examples. By the way, the template comes with spacing fixes for the
automated placement of brackets.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Typesetting text}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Along with the standard environments, this template offers
\verb|paralist| for lists within paragraphs.
%
Here's a quick example: The American constitution speaks, among others, of
%
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
  \item life
  \item liberty
  \item the pursuit of happiness.
\end{inparaenum}
%
These should be added in equal measure to your own conduct. To typeset
units correctly, use the \verb|siunitx| package. For example, you might
want to restrict your daily intake of liberty to \SI{750}{\milli\gram}.

Likewise, as a small pet peeve of the \texttt{latex-mimosis} author, the package offers specific operators for
\emph{ordinals}. Use \verb|\th| to typeset things like July~4\th
correctly. Or, if you are referring to the 2\nd edition of a book,
please use \verb|\nd|. Likewise, if you came in 3\rd in a marathon, use
\verb|\rd|. This is my 1\st rule.

If you want to write a text in German and use German hyphenation rules, set the language of your text to german using \verb|\selectlanguage{ngerman}|, or add
\begin{verbatim}
\PassOptionsToPackage{spanish}{babel}
\end{verbatim}
before the \verb|\documentclass| command to load a specific language. The languages \verb|ngerman|, \verb|french|, and \verb|english| are loaded by default, with \verb|english| being selected.

Quotation marks can be typeset using the \verb|\enquote{...}| command from the \verb|csquotes| package, which is preloaded by \verb|latex-mimosis|.
Depending on the currently selected language, quotes will look like \enquote{this},
\selectlanguage{ngerman}\enquote{this}\selectlanguage{english},
or
\selectlanguage{french}\enquote{this}\selectlanguage{english}.
One must never use "ASCII" quotation marks or even 'apostrophe' symbols.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Changing things}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Since this class heavily relies on the \verb|scrbook| class, you can use
\emph{their} styling commands in order to change the look of things. For
example, if you want to change the text in sections to \textbf{bold} you
can just use
%
\begin{verbatim}
  \setkomafont{sectioning}{\normalfont\bfseries}
\end{verbatim}
%
at the end of the document preamble---you don't have to modify the class
file for this. Please consult the source code for more information.
